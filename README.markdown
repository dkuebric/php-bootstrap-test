This is a test harness for a [PHP Bootstrap](https://github.com/sergeychernyshev/php-bootstrap/) project.

Use `httpd.sample.conf` file to set up Apache hosts.

Then edit `docroot` and `outside_of_docroot` variables in Makefile and run `make` to set up all file copies of the project. You can always run `make clean' to remove them.
